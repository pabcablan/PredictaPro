## **Key Features**
### 1. **Data Cleaning**
Removes outliers from datasets using statistical techniques:
- Calculates mean and standard deviation.
- Removes data points that deviate significantly from the dataset's trends.
- Ensures data quality by keeping only relevant and realistic values.
 
### 2. **Value Prediction**
Uses simple linear regression to predict future trends:
- Predicts the next data point based on existing trends.
- Provides meaningful insights for future planning.

### 3. **Report Visualization**

Creates tabular reports that compare raw and cleaned data:
- Highlights adjustments made during data cleaning.
- Presents original and cleaned values alongside timestamps.

### 4. **Data Analysis**

Calculates statistical metrics for cleaned datasets:
- Average value.
- Minimum and maximum values.
- Range of data.
